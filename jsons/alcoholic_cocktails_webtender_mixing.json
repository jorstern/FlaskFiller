Brian Sinnott is an ex-fiance of Kristine Hunter, middle sister of Beth Hunter, who is my ex-wife. Anyway, his family created this tremendously wonderful \"kool-aid\" punch, and used it for all of their family occasions. Through careful scientific experimentation, I have created a wonderful and magnificent champagne-kool-aid punch to use for parties, New Year, Christmas, birthday celebrations, etc. Printed above are instructions for the \"leaded\" version of the drink. Be careful, it can pack quite a blow, especially if you add more vodka, as suggested. This is a sweet drink, so cheep Andre \"pink\" champagne or any other sparkling wine will do. I would recommend using a good brand of vodka, then potency adjustments are less noticeable. This is a wonderful tasting champagne punch, despite its Kool-Aid roots. One batch is probably good for a party of 5-10 people. Make two batches for medium parties of 10-20 people. (This also maximizes the fact that frozen juice usually comes in 12oz sizes anyway.)",

First Pour in all of the Grain (10 bottles of 1.75ml [Handle]), keep in mind that this recipie is for a Large Party, not 10 people sitting around getting loaded.....Anyway, next add the dry packets of mix. We used to get the largest industrial bags we could, don't go for quality, you're not going to remember anyway. Now this is the most critical part, the fruit. This is why I put this on here...any joker can make punch, but I figured I would distibute my years of fruit research for free....the Best friends you have in the Fruit community are the Orange and the Apple. This is because they absorb the grain better than anything else I tested. So make sure you get some of these in every glass you get, and eat them, DON'T EVER THROW THESE OUT, this is the best part of the drink. Bananas suck, they get gushy, watermellon works ok but the seeds get to be a pain in the ass when you can't see so well, pineapple is good, basically you get the point. Cut the fruit into wedges and throw it in the mix and let it sit around for a minute...Now throw in the bags of ice and fill it up to desired potency with water, mixing can be done with a canoe paddle or a 2x4 or anything else you've got lying around...a disposable camera is usually a good partner while drinking this concoction, people get really outta hand and go off the deep end.....This goes well as an iceblock shot too.",

Bring to a boil (remember to stir constantly!), and the concoction will froth up. Remove from heat, let the froth subside, and repeat this cycle three more times. This is why your pot has to be bigger: the frothing would cause a major spill if you used a smaller pot. Serve and drink while hot. You can also adjust sweetness in your cup. Some people may want to strain this, as the ground spices sometimes have some coarse particles. This is a very nice hot drink, with a definite indian-food flavour, spicy-sweet and rich. The original recipe using milk also called for a tablespoon of butter for each serving (yuk!), and that was intended to make the drink rich-tasting.

I posted a \"leaded\" version of this drink on the Webtender that uses sparkling wine, vodka, and rum to make a champagne-cool-aid punch. This is a wonderful tasting punch, despite its Kool-Aid roots. I prefer its nice sweet, tangy, and bubbly taste to the more popular sherbet punches you find at parties. One batch is probably good for a party of 5-10 people. Make two batches for medium parties of 10-20 people. (This also maximizes the fact that frozen juice usually comes in 12oz sizes anyway.)",
